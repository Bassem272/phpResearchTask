Variable Case Sensitivity:
In PHP, variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that the same variable name with different capitalization can be treated as separate variables. For example:
```php
$x = "hello";
$X = "world";
echo $x; // Output: hello
echo $X; // Output: world
```
As you can see, the two variables `$x` and `$X` have different values because they were declared with different capitalization.

Function Case Sensitivity:

PHP functions are also case-sensitive, so the same function name with different capitalization can be treated as separate functions. For example:
```php
function foo() {
    echo "Hello";
}

function FOO() {
    echo "World";
}

foo(); // Output: Hello
FOO(); // Output: World
```
Again, the two functions `foo()` and `FOO()` have different implementations because they were declared with different capitalization.

Reserved Keywords:

PHP has a set of reserved keywords that cannot be used as variable names or function names. These keywords include:

* array
* break
* callable
* case
* catch
* class
* clone
* const
* continue
* declare
* default
* die
* do
* echo
* else
* empty
* enddeclare
* endfor
* endif
* eval
* exit
* extract
* final
* for
* foreach
* get_class
* goto
* if
* implement
* interface
* isset
* list
* loop
* mirror
* new
* private
* protected
* public
* require
* require_once
* return
* static
* switch
* throw
* try
* unset
* var
* void
* while

It's important to note that these reserved words cannot be used as variable names or function names, as they will cause syntax errors.

Overall, it's important to be mindful of variable and function case sensitivity when writing PHP code, as well as avoiding the use of reserved keywords as variable names or function names. This will help prevent syntax errors and improve the readability and maintainability of your code.
